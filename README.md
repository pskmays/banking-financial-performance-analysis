## Overview
This project simulates a real-world financial analytics engagement for a regional banking corporation. The executive leadership team required visibility into branch performance, departmental spending, cost center variance, and overall budget utilization.

I designed and queried a relational database in MySQL to explore financial and operational data across 12 interrelated tables. After validating relationships and extracting key metrics using SQL, I connected Excel directly to the database using Power Query to clean, transform, and model the data.

The final deliverable was an executive-ready Excel dashboard highlighting budget vs. actual performance, departmental breakdowns, regional trends, and over-budget cost centers.

## Dataset
The dataset simulates financial and operational data from a regional banking corporation. It includes 12 relational tables covering departments, branches, budgets, expenditures, cost centers, regions, employees, customers, transactions, and loan applications.

The structured format allows for budget vs. actual analysis, cost center performance evaluation, regional financial comparisons, and overall operational insight.

## Database
To facilitate data management and analysis, a SQL database has been created to store the dataset. SQL provides a robust and efficient way to query and manipulate the data. The database schema has been designed to ensure proper organization and ease of use. The structure of the database enables seamless integration with various data visualization tools.

## Data Processing
The data obtained from the U.S. government website might require some preprocessing to clean and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. SQL queries have been utilized to clean, filter, and transform the data as necessary. This ensures that the data used for the dashboard is accurate and reliable.

## Project includes:

**Overview:** A summary of key performance indicators, such as total sales, top-performing categories, and regional distribution of sales.

**Sales by NAICS Code:** Visual representations of sales figures for various NAICS codes, allowing users to identify the most significant contributors to overall sales.

**Sales by Category:** Graphs and charts illustrating sales for different categories within Retail and Food Services.

**Geographical Analysis:** Maps and charts showing sales distribution across different regions of the U.S.A.

**Time Series Analysis:** Trends and seasonal patterns in sales data, helping users to identify patterns over time.

**Filtering and Interactivity:** Interactive elements allowing users to filter data based on specific criteria and perform ad-hoc analysis.

## Technologies Used
**SQL:** For data extraction, transformation, and loading into the database.

**Database Management System:** PostgreSQL to host and manage the dataset.


**Programming Languages:**  SQL for data processing and scripting.



**Conclusion**
The Sales for Retail and Food Services in U.S.A. project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data within the Retail and Food Services sectors. The use of SQL and data from the U.S. government website ensures data accuracy and reliability. The interactive dashboard offers a user-friendly interface to explore the data visually and gain valuable insights. This project is valuable for businesses, policymakers, and researchers looking to understand and leverage sales trends in the U.S.A.
